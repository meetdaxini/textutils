This website provides text utilities like punctuation remover, character count, UPPERCASE, lowercase, new line remover, and space remover.You can use multiple utilities together also. For example Lets say you want punctuation removed and also it's character count after that.

It also provides a random password generator with options to change length and include uppercase letters, digits and special characters to get a secure and random password.
